Start by creating a new Notebook for this assignment. **[DONE]**\n2. Use the Notebook to build the code to scrape the following Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal codes and to transform the data into a *pandas* dataframe like the one shown below:\n\n![alt text][logo]\n\n3. To create the above dataframe:  \n  \n  \n* The dataframe will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood **[DONE]**\n* Only process the cells that have an assigned borough. Ignore cells with a borough that is **Not assigned**. **[DONE]**\n* More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, you will notice that **M5A** is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: **Harbourfront** and **Regent Park**. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in **row 11** in the above table. **[DONE]**\n* If a cell has a borough but a **Not assigned** neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough. So for the **9th** cell in the table on the Wikipedia page, the value of the Borough and the Neighborhood columns will be **Queen's Park**. **[DONE]**\n* Clean your Notebook and add Markdown cells to explain your work and any assumptions you are making. **[DONE]**\n* In the last cell of your notebook, use the .shape method to print the number of rows of your dataframe. **[DONE]**\n\n\n**Note:** There are different website scraping libraries and packages in Python. For scraping the above table, you can simply use *pandas* to read the table into a *pandas* dataframe.\n\nAnother way, which would help to learn for more complicated cases of web scraping is using the BeautifulSoup package. Here is the package's main documentation page: http://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nThe package is so popular that there is a plethora of tutorials and examples on how to use it. Here is a very good Youtube video on how to use the BeautifulSoup package: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k\n\nUse *pandas*, or the BeautifulSoup package, or any other way you are comfortable with to transform the data in the table on the Wikipedia page into the above pandas dataframe.\n\n[logo]: https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7JXaz3NNEeiMwApe4i-fLg_40e690ae0e927abda2d4bde7d94ed133_Screen-Shot-2018-06-18-at-7.17.57-PM.png?expiry=1577923200000&hmac=5pnBiPm5sXBYCe9OAcumreGkgKKmkttIDlQAcgxHbKk"
